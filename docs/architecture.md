# CodexHub Architecture

Date: 2026-07-30
Target: Cross-platform desktop MVP using Tauri 2, React, TypeScript, Vite, and Rust, with Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu/Debian x86_64 plus arm64 Linux deb release-build support.

## Architecture Principle

CodexHub is a desktop control plane for Codex App SSH-based remote development. MVP does not require a remote Codex wrapper. CodexHub connects to the user's remote Linux hosts over SSH/SFTP and directly manages remote Codex files:

- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `~/.codex/skills/`

Codex App remains the interactive coding surface. CodexHub may reload strictly identified Codex processes on the remote Linux host after profile apply, but it does not control the local ChatGPT/Codex App or touch its private state.

The local platform layer owns OS-specific paths and command discovery. Windows keeps `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config`, while macOS and Linux use `~/.ssh/config`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/skills`, and the Codex binary search order documented in `docs/macos-support.md` and `docs/linux-support.md`.

## Frontend Modules

- Servers: host inventory, aliases, labels, SSH config status, connection health.
- Profiles: local profile templates, CRUD/import/export, env-var-first API key policy, rendered remote TOML preview, single or selected-host batch apply, and a per-run remote Codex reload choice.
- Skills: local skill packages, GitHub search/clone import, installed-skill tag preview/download/uninstall, remote upload/install status, and remote list.
- Monitor: page-active host sampling with compact CPU, memory, and GPU cards plus expandable, read-only per-user GPU process details.
- Operations: backup, apply, restore, dry-run, and audit log.
- Codex App Fallback: manual steps for enabling SSH hosts and reconnecting in the local ChatGPT/Codex App.
- Settings: local data location, remote paths, OpenSSH binary overrides, theme, and privacy controls.
- Workspace / 工作台: a dedicated Terminal, Files, Split, and Transfers surface. It owns its own scroll containers and xterm refs; terminal bytes never enter React state or durable task logs.

## Workspace Session Layer

`WorkspaceManager` owns the short-lived interactive resources separately from the existing one-shot SSH executor. It starts no remote daemon, and its Terminal/SSH connection path never parses, copies, or persists a private key; every connection names the user's existing OpenSSH alias, so OpenSSH continues to resolve `Include`, `Match`, `ProxyJump`, `IdentityFile`, agent, and `known_hosts` behavior. Files is a separate user-operated file surface and may read, preview, copy, or transfer any local file the current OS user explicitly selects and can access.

- Terminal sessions use `portable-pty` with the system `ssh -tt` client, platform-native PTY support, `ServerAliveInterval=15`, `ServerAliveCountMax=3`, and TCP keepalive. A logical `term-<uuid>` survives reconnect while each PTY receives a strictly increasing generation. Raw output is Base64 framed at 32 KiB, coalesced for at most 16 ms, retained for replay until frontend ACK, and bounded by a 4 MiB unacknowledged buffer. Inputs, resize, and ACK require the current generation. Network failures retry at 1/2/5/10/30 seconds; authentication, host-key failures, normal shell exit, and explicit close do not retry.
- Files sessions support two real desktop targets. Remote targets use `ssh -T -s <alias> sftp` with `openssh-sftp-client`; the local target uses Rust filesystem APIs and starts at `C:/` on Windows or `/` on macOS/Linux. Both targets provide pagination, bounded search, preview, copy, transfers, opaque entry references, and recovery-backed mutations. SFTP handles and local entry capabilities remain in memory; durable recovery records retain only the stable local/host identity needed to reopen the target safely.
- For aliases whose resolved `ssh -G` output reports `remotecommand none`, Terminal sends a per-generation nonce-bound PID probe and Files canonicalizes `/proc/<pid>/cwd` through the matching SFTP session. An unavailable `/proc` path falls back to an SFTP-canonicalized OSC 7 candidate; prompt parsing is never used. A Files-originated “open terminal here” request undergoes the same host/canonical-directory check. CodexHub sends the one backend-built, single-quoted `cd` only when `ssh -G` confirms that the alias has no `RemoteCommand`; otherwise it returns an explicit unavailable error. Reconnects may attempt the same safe restore from the last verified cwd but never replay user input or foreground programs.
- Transfer rows and remote recovery records are durable SQLite state; task rows are a redacted audit trail. Workers have fixed global/per-host slots and record `preflight`, `transfer`, `verify`, and `commit` task steps without storing paths, file content, terminal output, or credentials. High-frequency progress uses transient events. A durable transfer row never preserves browser/local-path authority: after process memory loses its plan, resume or retry requires a newly selected one-time native grant plus a matching Files session, then rechecks the saved fingerprint and parent boundary.
- Files mutations use prepare → explicit UI confirmation → fresh lstat/fingerprint verification → recovery record. Delete, overwrite, and rename place recoverable backups under the same-parent `.codexhub-workspace-backups/<recoveryId>/`; purge requires a separate prepared confirmation. Copy is create-if-absent and never replaces an existing destination. Local symbolic links and special files remain outside mutation/copy traversal.

Workspace events are versioned by terminal generation/revision or transfer/search revision. The desktop API treats them as authoritative state updates and rejects stale generations/revisions. Mock mode returns `desktop-backend-required` for every Workspace action and never fabricates a PTY, remote directory, transfer, or progress event.

## Feedback And Accessibility

`AppErrorBoundary -> FeedbackProvider -> App` is the root composition. Every notification starts closing within five seconds and uses a one-second transition: it enters with a short upward movement plus blur-to-sharp reveal, then exits with the inverse downward blur. Pointer, keyboard, touch, wheel, or scroll input starts the exit immediately. Information, warning, success, and failure use theme-aware pale blue, yellow, green, and red surfaces with stronger semantic borders and an elevated shadow. While a host-operation progress modal is mounted, its completion Toast uses `global` placement and is centered over the full app viewport; without that modal, the same Toast uses `detail` placement and is centered over the content pane. Other notifications may still request an explicit placement. Durable writes, live SSH, remote probes, installs, updates, applies, syncs, migrations, recoveries, and partial failures still have a persistent task; form validation, copy confirmation, and pure UI actions stay transient.

The Tasks page reads the authoritative retained SQLite history and displays at most 100 task records. Host tests and remote Codex maintenance use the same `OperationProgressPanel` for live progress and retained history with two disclosure levels: every durable `TaskStep`, including a failed step, starts as a collapsed summary card; opening it reveals concise log rows, and opening one log row reveals its command, exit status, duration, timeout state, stdout, and stderr. Legacy tasks without steps are presented as one synthetic history card without rewriting their stored rows. The persisted `hostOperationLogPopups` setting defaults to enabled for existing and new installations. Disabling it suppresses only automatic live progress modals for host tests and Codex install, update, uninstall, and batch update; execution, persistence, completion Toasts, and the authoritative Tasks history continue unchanged. The persisted `personalInfoMasking` setting also defaults to enabled. Its display layer masks known SSH usernames, host addresses, endpoints, and user-bearing home paths across pages and logs while preserving port numbers and the original connection and stored task data. GPU process usernames on the Monitor page remain visible so operators can identify process ownership. Resource sampling uses a three-host sliding pool and emits a request-scoped transient progress event as each host finishes, so the monitor replaces that host's card immediately while the final batch result remains in configured host order. It creates a durable task only for the first monitor-page entry and explicit manual refreshes; scheduled auto-refresh updates the cards without writing task history. Sidebar success and failure dots use the same transient completion state and clear when the user enters or interacts with the owning page; durable failures remain available in Tasks without pinning a sidebar indicator.

All app modals use shared Radix Dialog/AlertDialog wrappers while retaining existing CSS variables. They trap Tab/Shift+Tab, choose form or Cancel initial focus, close through the same Esc path, prevent accidental backdrop closure, block closure while a write is busy, and restore focus to the real trigger or active navigation item. Live regions are scoped to the changed message, and `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables animations/transitions without hiding static busy text.

Rust wire contracts for structured errors, tasks, storage, Settings, updater status, Hosts, Profiles, Skills, SSH, resource monitoring, and profile-apply results are generated with `ts-rs` into `src/generated/rust-contracts.ts`. UI-normalized view models remain in `src/models.ts`; generated files are never edited manually.

## Rust Backend Services

The backend migration boundary is `commands -> services -> jobs -> storage/adapters`:

- `commands/` contains thin Tauri entry points only: parse wire arguments, pass `AppState` to one domain use case, and return the existing public command shape. All public command names remain stable.
- `services/` owns use-case sequencing and compensation. Hosts/SSH, Profiles/credentials, Skills, updater, related Host/Profile writes, and storage migration/restore are separated into use-case and operation modules.
- `jobs.rs` persists queued/running/final task transitions and redacts every step summary and log surface before SQLite writes. All Rust task-log constructors share one nonce-backed ID allocator, while SQLite keeps display order in its independent sequence column. A step and its optional detail log are committed atomically before the task-update notification is emitted; monotonic merging prevents stale parallel snapshots from moving a durable running or terminal step back to pending. Task payload validation rejects duplicate IDs and cross-step identity reuse before replacement. A caller-side payload invariant failure terminates only that task and keeps the healthy store available; genuine database availability failures still gate later durable operations. Tauri event delivery remains diagnostic because SQLite is authoritative.
- `storage/` owns app-scoped paths, versioned JSON, atomic replacement, backup/recovery, multi-file compensation, and the SQLite `TaskStore` repository. Task schema v4 adds `task_steps` plus `task_logs.step_id`; upgrades checkpoint WAL, create and validate a `VACUUM INTO` snapshot, then migrate transactionally. Startup marks queued/running tasks as interrupted, running steps as failed, and pending steps as skipped. Task history keeps at most the latest 100 task records. Before automatic retention or manual clearing deletes completed rows, complete tasks, steps, and logs are serialized into a recovery JSON file and moved through the operating system recycle-bin API; task-level tombstones prevent stale async snapshots from restoring recycled records. Running and queued tasks are never recycled.
- `adapters/` isolates event delivery and OS credentials. Existing `ssh.rs`, `resource_monitor.rs`, and `updater.rs` remain compatibility adapters behind services.

`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` contains module wiring and shared imports only; Tauri builder/lifecycle assembly lives in `app_runtime.rs`, wire/domain types in `domain.rs`, and backend characterization tests in `backend_tests.rs`.

`AppState` contains only `Arc<AppServices>`. `AppServices` owns resolved `AppPaths`, repositories, event adapters, and in-memory read caches; JSON/SQLite remain authoritative when data is reloaded.

Tauri command surface:

The complete desktop/mock failure policy is documented in [Desktop Command Boundaries](desktop-command-boundaries.md). Desktop command failures never fall back to Mock results.

- `app_health()`: smoke-test command exposed by the desktop backend.

## Local Data Model

Authoritative low-frequency settings, hosts, profiles, and skill metadata use versioned JSON. Searchable task runs, steps, logs, acknowledgement, schema history, cross-file operation journals, and backup metadata use SQLite. Rebuildable Codex-version and skill-inventory data lives under the app cache directory. API key values remain only in the OS credential store.

Durable JSON v1 is `{ schemaVersion, updatedAt, data }`. Legacy arrays/objects are readable as v0, but writes remain locked until the user previews and confirms a SHA-256 fingerprinted migration. Changed writes create timestamped backups and use same-directory flush/validate/atomic replacement; unchanged writes create no backup. Corrupt data never silently falls back to a backup.

SQLite enables foreign keys, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, and a busy timeout. Schema v4 stores ordered `TaskStep` rows and associates detailed `TaskLog` rows through optional `stepId`; old tasks load with an empty step list. Startup converges interrupted task and step states, and future schema upgrades retain the same validated-snapshot plus transactional-migration rule.

## Release Channel Data Isolation

CodexHub v0.5.0 continues to define exactly two release channels: `stable` and `dev`.

- `stable` is the public release channel. It uses `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `productName: CodexHub`, `identifier: app.codexhub.desktop`, and window title `CodexHub`.
- `dev` is for development, test runs, previews, and manual acceptance. It uses `src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json`, `productName: CodexHub Dev`, `identifier: dev.codexhub.desktop`, and window title `CodexHub Dev`.

The backend resolves Tauri `app_config_dir()` and `app_cache_dir()` exactly once during setup and never falls back to a relative app-data path. `settings.json`, `hosts.json`, `profiles.json`, and `skills.json` use the config directory. `skills-inventory.json`, `codex-latest.json`, temporary profile-apply files, Codex download staging, and cloned GitHub skill caches use the cache directory. Legacy cache files are copied and checksum-verified without deleting the old source. Tauri scopes both roots by bundle identifier, so `stable` and `dev` stay isolated.

In desktop mode, backend `settings.json` is the authoritative settings source. Frontend local storage is only a first-render cache and updates after confirmed backend reads or writes. Explicit Mock mode uses a separate browser-storage key.

This isolation does not automatically isolate shared local or remote surfaces. `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config`, local SSH keys, remote `~/.codex/config.toml`, remote `~/.codex/skills/`, and remote shell files remain shared unless the user deliberately points a workflow at separate hosts, aliases, or paths. Any write to those surfaces must keep the same scoped-write, backup, idempotency, and redaction rules.

See [release channel details](release-channels.md).

## Desktop Lifecycle

CodexHub creates a Tauri tray/status icon at startup using the app icon and display name (`CodexHub` or `CodexHub Dev`). Left-clicking the icon restores and focuses the main window. The icon menu exposes Show and Quit actions; Quit always calls the app exit path.

The main window close button is controlled by persisted `settings.json` field `closeButtonBehavior` with values `ask`, `exit`, or `minimize-to-tray`. Legacy settings without the field default to `ask`. In `ask` mode, the Rust close handler prevents the native close and emits `close-button-behavior-requested`; the React modal lets the user choose Exit app or Minimize to tray, persists the choice through `choose_close_button_behavior`, and immediately performs the selected action. Explicit Quit entries, including tray Quit and the macOS app menu / `Cmd+Q`, remain true exit paths and are not governed by the close-button preference.

macOS keeps the Dock icon in v1. Menu bar/status item behavior, close-to-hidden behavior, restore behavior, and `Cmd+Q` have prior real-Mac validation. Re-run the macOS checklist after lifecycle, packaging, or menu-bar behavior changes, including each new public macOS artifact.

## Stable Updater Foundation

CodexHub wires Tauri 2 updater checks only for `stable`. The backend initializes `tauri-plugin-updater` and exposes `get_app_update_status()`, `check_stable_update()`, and gated `install_stable_update()` commands so Settings can display a compact Version info table and a manual install action only after a signed update is discovered.

Stable updater network access follows the persisted `settings.json` proxy fields `networkProxyMode` and `networkProxyUrl`. Auto mode tries direct access first, then configured environment proxies and reachable localhost proxy ports; Manual mode retries through the configured URL. Proxy routes are logged with credentials redacted, and Tauri signature verification still gates installation.

Remote Codex install/update reuses the same proxy preference before direct official-installer access whenever an eligible local proxy is available. `direct` disables this route. `auto` and `manual` accept only reachable, credential-free HTTP/HTTPS proxies bound to this computer's loopback interface. Each candidate gets up to two advisory local preflight attempts against safely named official installer and Codex release endpoints; transient preflight failure is logged by endpoint and failure category but does not block a real tunnel attempt. Every concurrent host owns a separate SSH process and exposes its selected remote loopback port through `-R 127.0.0.1:<remote>:127.0.0.1:<local>` with `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, so all hosts can use the same local proxy simultaneously without sharing remote listeners. A tunnel or network failure falls back to direct remote access and then the existing mirror chain. Proxy variables exist only inside that remote installer shell, remote ports come from deterministic high-port candidates, and no proxy setting is persisted on the host. SOCKS, authenticated, and non-loopback proxy URLs remain unavailable for this path.

Each `check_stable_update()` attempt records a local `Check app update` task run. Frontend update-check failures open the task log modal immediately, avoid rendering the full error inline below the Version card, and point users to the Tasks detail page for later review.

The stable updater is pending until the release build injects `CODEXHUB_STABLE_UPDATE_ENDPOINT` and `CODEXHUB_STABLE_UPDATER_PUBKEY`. The build/runtime path normalizes the updater public key to the direct Tauri public key string before checking signatures. The stable Check button can still be clicked so Settings reports `pending-configuration` honestly when those values are absent. Windows signed updater assets are produced by the dedicated release workflow with Tauri updater artifacts enabled, then published through `latest.json`; the public Release keeps the setup installer, `latest.json`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` rather than a standalone `.sig` asset. macOS Apple Silicon uses an unsigned/ad-hoc `.dmg` for installation and an updater `.app.tar.gz` archive, with unsigned status documented only outside the app UI. Linux publishes signed Ubuntu/Debian `.deb` feed entries as `linux-x86_64` and `linux-aarch64` after real Linux desktop validation. `dev` stays non-updating and is handled by local builds, preview packages, or test artifacts. Installer/download actions remain disabled unless the real feed, signatures, and publisher workflow are approved and the latest check returns `available`.

See [stable updater details](stable-updater.md).

## Remote Host Tests And Codex Maintenance

Host tests and Codex install/update/uninstall are implemented through plain SSH. CodexHub keeps the user-facing remote command as `codex`; profile apply may install a same-name CodexHub-managed launcher under `~/.local/bin/codex` only to source managed environment variables before execing the real Codex binary.

A host test first runs `ssh-check`, then runs the `system`, `codex`, `api`, and `skills` probe groups concurrently. Each group uses one structured remote script. A missing Codex installation, API config, or skills directory is a successful negative result; transport, command, timeout, parse, or persistence errors fail only the affected group and do not overwrite previously trusted fields.

Install and update keep this strict per-host order:

1. `preparation`: verify SSH and the current Codex/platform/tool state without changing PATH or starting an installer.
2. `process-impact`: for every Update, revalidate the complete previewed current-UID PID/starttime/release/comm/process-kind set. Explicitly approved hosts first receive exact-PID `SIGTERM`; stubborn identities and safely classified replacement processes bound to an approved release may then receive exact-PID `SIGKILL` for at most six cycles, and installation starts only after two consecutive stable scans are empty. Unknown, other-UID, outside-approved-release, or unverifiable processes fail closed. Install and uninstall keep the single-host bypass because they do not replace an existing managed runtime through this Update path.
3. `path-repair`: prepare user-owned directories and PATH files with backups where needed.
4. `official-installer`: run `https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh` with strict TLS and user-directory environment variables; before mutation, stream-parse exactly one top-level `rust-v` tag from either compact or formatted official GitHub release JSON and enforce the locked version floor. An eligible local proxy is attempted first through the host's bounded temporary reverse tunnel, followed by direct access on tunnel or network failure. This stage has a dedicated 360-second outer SSH budget, while the downloaded installer subprocess remains bounded to 240 seconds so timeout handling can still restore the locked runtime before SSH exits.
5. `remote-native-mirror`: fetch and validate the matching npmmirror native package remotely; the narrowly scoped insecure-TLS retry remains inside this stage.
6. `remote-npm-mirror`: use remote npm with the npmmirror registry and a user-owned prefix.
7. `local-upload`: download and validate the native package locally, upload it with SCP, then install it remotely.
8. `runtime-reconcile`: coordinate a verified standalone target and launcher with `standalone/current`, then verify the target, launcher, and login-shell command report the same version without regressing below either safe pre-update version floor.
9. `final-verification`: resolve the final binary, verify its version, require login-shell command availability, and retain current non-login shell visibility as a diagnostic PATH warning that does not block success.
10. `release-cleanup`: after final verification, Install removes only eligible marked releases, while Update adopts every strictly identifiable lower release and moves it into a staged backup; retain current, targeted, same/newer, active, or uncertain identities.

Fallback methods on one host are always sequential. The first successful method skips the remaining methods, and overall success requires final verification. Uninstall uses `preparation`, `uninstall`, and `final-verification`; Codex being absent after removal is a successful verification result.

The Rust backend executes blocking SSH/curl/scp work off the window-responsive command path and emits `host-operation-progress` events keyed by `requestId`, task, host, operation, and durable `TaskStep`. Heartbeats remain transient and are not stored as task logs. The shared progress panel keeps step cards collapsed by default, exposes concise messages on the first disclosure, and exposes command/output diagnostics only from an individual log row's second disclosure. Single-host and batch Update complete read-only process preflights before opening confirmation. The dialog classifies App services, App SSH proxies, and other Codex sessions using a bounded label while keeping raw argv remote-only. Unknown classifications cannot be selected. Clear hosts continue automatically; selected impacted hosts authorize the bounded TERM-to-KILL update gate for exact approved identities and safely classified replacements from the same approved releases. Declined or unverifiable hosts immediately receive failed tasks stating that no forced update ran. Batch host tests and updates use a fixed six-host sliding pool; hosts run concurrently, each host keeps its own ordered workflow and independent proxy tunnel where applicable, and returned results remain in input order. A batch host test refreshes the latest Codex version once in parallel with the host queue and returns that shared comparison value separately from per-host results.

The remote script must not use `sudo`, `/usr/local/bin`, `chown`, or a root-owned install path. Repeat runs should not duplicate the PATH block and should not create a backup when no shell config write is needed.

The primary UI entry is the host table on the Hosts / 主机 page, which owns single-host and batch maintenance actions plus the shared progress modal. Profiles / 配置 remains focused on profile editing and apply workflows.

## Managed Runtime Coordination And Release Cleanup

Install/Update and Profile apply share one internal runtime reconciliation path. For a CodexHub-managed standalone runtime, `~/.codex-hub/codex-target` stores the canonical executable selected through `~/.codex/packages/standalone/current`: `bin/codex` for local and current official package releases, including the official package's exact `codex -> bin/codex` compatibility link, or `codex` for the legacy official layout. Two independent executable paths, broken links, and links with any other target remain ambiguous. The target file does not store a resolved `releases/<entry>/<binary>` path. The same-name `~/.local/bin/codex` launcher reads that target after sourcing the managed env, and reconciliation succeeds only when the target, launcher, and login-shell `codex --version` values agree. Target and launcher replacements are staged atomically with backups and rollback on failed verification.

Update passes both the active version and the separately verified pre-operation `standalone/current` version into reconciliation as minimums; the latter also records the exact release entry and binary layout so recovery never guesses by glob. Every CodexHub runtime writer publishes an atomic current-UID/PID/starttime owner record, then re-reads canonical current, active-command, and login-shell versions while holding the shared lock. Installers and reconciliation treat the highest comparable observation as a monotonic floor and verify the post-mutation state before reporting success. A concurrent or identity-ambiguous writer fails safely instead of proceeding with stale probe data.

A final runtime below any verified floor is rejected. If an installation method moved `current` to a lower release while the verified former release is still intact, reconciliation restores that exact higher release before activating the launcher. When every installation method fails after possibly changing `current` or the launcher, the same recovery reconcile still restores an available pre-operation floor while preserving the original failed operation result. The Task remains failed, while persisted Host readiness follows the final path/version probe so a successfully restored runtime is not falsely recorded as uninstalled. Profile apply captures the login-shell-visible version before any launcher/target write and uses it as another floor, so applying configuration cannot replace a higher active runtime with an older release target. Signal handlers arm rollback before destructive moves and restore target/launcher state before the writer lock is released. This capability is an internal stage of the existing operations, not a standalone Host/API action.

Cleanup scans only direct children of `~/.codex/packages/standalone/releases`. A candidate entry may equal the binary version or use the official `<version>-<vendor-target>` form and must expose exactly one canonical executable whose reported version matches the entry. The official package's exact `codex -> bin/codex` compatibility link counts as the same `bin/codex` layout; two independent executables, broken links, and every other link target remain ambiguous. Install and Profile apply require an existing valid `.codexhub-managed-release` marker. Update receives the final verified version only after final installation checks; for a strictly lower candidate with no marker path, it atomically writes the exact marker under the shared writer lock and then uses the verified Update backup path. A valid existing marker remains eligible, while an invalid marker is never overwritten. Same-version and higher-version releases are retained without adoption.

Every mode protects the canonical `standalone/current` release and the release selected by `codex-target`. A current-UID process also prevents cleanup. During Update, a strictly lower in-use release may receive its strict marker before being retained, allowing a later managed-only cleanup retry after the process exits. The cleanup result reports adoption and staged-backup counts separately from the mutually exclusive removed-from-active, retained, and deferred counts, plus a safe backup ID rather than an absolute home path. It also reports the number of strictly classified session helpers covered by the staged-Update exception.

When reconciliation replaces a pre-existing regular-file `~/.local/bin/codex`, it first moves that executable to `~/.codex-hub/codex-original.<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>.<pid>` and atomically writes a `.codexhub-managed-capture` sidecar bound to the exact filename and normalized version. Rollback verifies the executable and sidecar, restores the executable first, and removes the sidecar only after restoration. Later cleanup considers only strict two-number capture names with an exact sidecar, preserves the capture selected by `codex-target` or used by a current-UID process, and leaves historical unmarked captures untouched.

Release and capture cleanup holds the same runtime writer lock used by install, update, uninstall, and reconciliation. Every candidate first uses a same-directory GNU `mv -T -n` quarantine followed by repeated lock ownership, canonical-path, marker, target/current, version, and current-UID process checks. The capability probe supports the no-clobber collision statuses used by coreutils 8.x and 9.4 (`0` or `1`) only when both collision files remain exact regular files and a separate destination-absent move returns `0`, removes its source, and preserves exact content. Normal `/proc` reads bind PID, UID, starttime, and executable across repeated reads so PID reuse defers cleanup. Only `verified-older-than + staged` Update may accept an unreadable executable link for strictly classified session infrastructure or an exited process: the existing `sshd`, `(sd-pam)`, `sftp-server`, and `fusermount3` classes; a `systemd` user manager whose complete command line is exactly `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user` or `/lib/systemd/systemd --user` with no extra argument; or a stable zombie with state `Z`, an empty command line, `Threads: 1`, and a `/proc/<pid>/task` directory containing only its leader TID. It double-reads UID/starttime/state/comm/full command line and executable visibility, repeats both single-thread proofs for zombies, treats a captured numeric TID that disappears during enumeration as a race, records a non-empty fixed-field snapshot, and requires that exact identity class at every later candidate check. Install/Profile cleanup stays strict; any new, changed, unknown, multi-thread zombie, or Codex-like process defers. For Update, the verified quarantine is then moved with another no-replace rename into `~/.codex-hub/deletion-backups/update-<UTC>-<PID>/`; the backup must share the source filesystem, has mode `700`, includes a manifest, and also receives eligible launcher captures plus known `~/.local/bin/codex.codexhub.bak.*` and `~/.codex/tmp/arg0/codex-arg0*/*` residual links. Because each candidate requires repeated process scans, this cleanup SSH stage has a dedicated 360-second cap. The official installer stage independently receives the bounded 360/240-second outer/inner budget described above; other ordinary SSH commands retain the 120-second cap. Update never automatically purges this backup. Unmarked releases remain untouched outside the verified Update adoption policy; unmanaged captures, active objects, races, invalid markers, and every other ambiguity outside the staged exception stay in place. Later Update or Profile apply can retry eligible marked objects. The cleanup path does not signal processes and never broad-deletes unknown release directories or captures.

Runtime coordination and cleanup operate only on the remote host over SSH. They do not read or communicate with local ChatGPT/Codex App private databases, sockets, caches, or IPC.

## Remote Write Algorithm

Every remote file mutation must be previewable, backed up, and idempotent.

1. Resolve target paths with conservative shell quoting.
2. Run `mkdir -p ~/.codex ~/.codex/skills` only after explicit apply.
3. If `~/.codex/config.toml` exists, download it for diff and create `~/.codex/config.toml.codexhub.bak.<timestamp>`.
4. Upload rendered TOML to `~/.codex/config.toml.codexhub.tmp.<operation-id>`.
5. Validate that the uploaded temp file is non-empty and has the expected checksum.
6. Move temp file to `~/.codex/config.toml` on the remote host.
7. If the rendered config is identical to the current remote config, report "no changes" and do not create a new config backup.
8. Write the selected remote API env, reconcile the managed launcher/runtime target, verify the env and runtime, then persist confirmed Host/Profile state locally.
9. Run the separately confirmed remote Codex reload step even when config/env files were unchanged; skip it when an apply prerequisite failed.
10. Retry safe managed-release cleanup after reload; keep the verified configuration and runtime active when an old release is still in use or its identity is uncertain.

## Profile And API Config Management

Window 5 profile switching is file-based and implemented through the direct SSH/SFTP path:

- CodexHub stores structured profile templates locally and supports CRUD plus import/export.
- API key handling is env-var-first. Rendered TOML uses `env_key` / `apiKeyEnvVar` so the remote host resolves its own environment variable.
- An optional API key value can be stored in the local OS credential store for local convenience, but only a `credentialStored` boolean is kept in profile JSON.
- When a profile with a stored key is explicitly applied to selected hosts, CodexHub writes the real key only to `~/.codex-hub/env` with mode `600`, creates a timestamped backup before replacing an existing env file, and adds managed source blocks to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, `.profile`, and existing `.bash_profile` / `.zprofile`.
- For a managed standalone install, the same apply step keeps `~/.codex-hub/codex-target` on the verified executable selected through `~/.codex/packages/standalone/current` and installs a command-preserving `~/.local/bin/codex` launcher that sources `~/.codex-hub/env` before execing that target. Reconciliation verifies the target, launcher, and login-shell command use one non-regressed version.
- Applying a profile renders the entire desired `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- CodexHub replaces the remote config after diff/backup, writes local/remote apply metadata, and checks whether the referenced remote API env var exists without printing its value.
- Apply can target one host or a selected-host batch, with each host producing a separate redacted task log.
- Every apply entry uses one confirmation dialog. The default `app-services` mode reloads confirmed `app-server`/`remote-control` services and preserves interactive CLI/exec sessions; `none` leaves all processes running; `all-codex` requires an extra acknowledgement before stopping every confirmed Codex process for that remote UID.
- A successful config apply is not rolled back when process reload needs manual recovery. The result becomes `manual-reconnect`, and the user follows `Settings > Codex > Connections` in the local ChatGPT/Codex App.

This avoids a separate user-facing wrapper command and avoids assumptions about Codex App internals. A future profile-selection wrapper can be added as an opt-in enhancement for hosts where runtime `codex --profile <name>` orchestration is desired.

## Remote Codex Reload Boundary

Remote reload is part of profile apply only; there is no standalone Host action. The backend reads `/proc/<pid>/status`, `stat`, `comm`, and `cmdline` to verify the current SSH UID, strict command/argv shape, and process start time, then repeats those checks immediately before sending `SIGTERM`. `app-services` targets only confirmed App services; `all-codex` also targets confirmed interactive, exec, login, resume, and automated sessions whose `comm`/argv identify the same `codex` command family. Multiple matches are handled individually.

The implementation never uses `pkill`, `killall`, process-group signals, negative PIDs, `SIGKILL`, or automatic escalation. It waits up to five seconds for old PIDs to exit and, when an App service existed, up to 15 seconds total for a strictly matched replacement. The start-time recheck prevents signaling a reused PID; an unreadable/suspicious identity, an old process that remains, or a missing replacement produces `manual-required`. SSH or result-protocol failure produces `failed`. Task logs retain only status/count summaries, never raw process command lines or the reload command's stdout/stderr.

This SSH operation does not establish IPC with the local ChatGPT/Codex App and does not read its databases, sockets, caches, or undocumented files. If automatic recovery is not observed within 15 seconds, the saved remote configuration remains active and the UI directs the user to `Settings > Codex > Connections` for a manual reconnect.

## Skill Management

Window 6 skill management is folder-based and uses the same direct SSH/SCP route as profile apply:

- Local import accepts a selected directory with `SKILL.md`, or scans immediate child directories and imports each valid child.
- Imported skills are copied into CodexHub-managed app config storage so later remote installs do not depend on the original source path.
- Online discovery accepts direct `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` / `.git` repository URLs and `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/<skill-path>` skill subdirectory URLs. Download uses `git clone --depth 1` and reuses the same `SKILL.md` scan on the selected root or subdirectory; preview details default to the `SKILL.md` frontmatter `description`.
- Installed-skill detection scans the local Codex skill root plus every configured host and persists the local and host skill inventory. Remote detection covers both `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.codex/superpowers/skills`, including hidden second-level layouts such as `.system/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Manual detection refreshes the host cache, the Refresh button reloads the page from the local cache only, and install/uninstall modals read the cache without probing every host on open.
- The Skills page presents one local library table with `Skill`, `Source`, `Added`, `Applied`, and `Actions` columns.
- The Skills page also presents an installed skill library table with local machine and host rows, showing alias, source, host IP, and compact clickable skill tags colored consistently by skill name.
- Clicking an installed-skill tag opens a preview modal. If the skill is already in the local library, the modal allows editing the local details and disables download; if it is not in the local library, editing is hidden and the user can confirm downloading that installed directory into the local library.
- The Applied column is derived from `SkillApplication` rows: local installs show the local machine label, host installs show the host alias, and empty applications show an unapplied badge.
- Target checks read the persisted inventory cache rather than probing every host on modal open. Already-installed, unavailable, or never-scanned targets are not selectable for install until detection refreshes the cache.
- Install packages the managed skill as `.tgz`, uploads to `/tmp`, extracts to staging, validates `SKILL.md`, and installs only to the default Codex skills root.
- Installed-skill tag uninstall requires a second confirmation and permanently removes only the current local or host skill directory. The warning must state that the directory is directly deleted and cannot be recovered.
- Delete can uninstall known applications first, or directly remove only the CodexHub local library record and managed copy.
- The MVP does not manage `.agents/skills`; keep path-drift handling as a later setting or host capability check.

## SSH Config Policy

Default behavior is read-only analysis of the platform SSH config path: `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config` on Windows and `~/.ssh/config` on macOS.

Optional write behavior must follow these rules:

- Generate a diff before writing.
- Create a timestamped backup beside the original config.
- Only manage marked CodexHub blocks.
- Preserve comments and unrelated `Host` blocks.
- Never overwrite private keys or shell config.

## Credential Policy

- Do not store SSH private keys or passphrases in CodexHub data files.
- Prefer Windows OpenSSH agent, Windows credential store, or references to existing key paths.
- If an API key must be remembered locally, store only through the OS credential store and keep profile JSON to non-secret credential state.
- Remote config must use `env_key` / `apiKeyEnvVar`; CodexHub must never write the stored local credential or an API key value to remote config, apply metadata, app JSON, or task logs.
- Profile apply may upload the stored key only to the selected host's CodexHub-managed `~/.codex-hub/env` file with mode `600` and redacted logs.
- Probes and profile apply tasks may report an env var as missing, but they must not print the env var value.
- Operation logs must redact usernames only when requested, but always redact key material, passphrases, tokens, and private host secrets.

## Codex App Fallback UX

Because no public stable API was found for automatic host registration or forcing the local App to reconnect, the MVP fallback is explicit:

1. Show the SSH alias CodexHub verified.
2. Show the exact local ChatGPT/Codex App navigation: Settings > Codex > Connections.
3. Provide copy buttons for the alias and test commands.
4. Show what CodexHub already changed on the remote host.
5. Provide rollback/restore actions for files CodexHub changed.
6. Avoid private Codex App files, databases, sockets, and undocumented IPC.

## Future Optional Wrapper

A remote wrapper is a later enhancement, not an MVP dependency. It may provide:

- Runtime profile selection without replacing the default config.
- Remote health endpoints.
- More precise Codex CLI checks.
- Remote-side atomic operations with richer validation.

Wrapper adoption must remain opt-in and must not block the direct SSH/SFTP path.
