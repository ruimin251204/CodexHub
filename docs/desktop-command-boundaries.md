# Desktop Command Boundaries

Date: 2026-07-13

CodexHub selects exactly one frontend API mode at build/start time:

- `desktop`: every operation uses the Tauri command bridge. A missing bridge, IPC failure, backend error, or validation error is returned to the UI; no command falls back to Mock data.
- `mock`: selected explicitly with Vite `mode=mock`. Operations use the isolated in-memory/browser Mock API and never access desktop files, the OS credential store, SSH, or remote hosts.

`hasTauriRuntime` only validates the desktop bridge. It never selects Mock mode. Initial UI placeholders are labelled loading or unavailable and are not successful command results.

## Command Matrix

| Policy | Commands | Desktop contract | Explicit Mock contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authoritative read | `app_health`, `get_app_update_status`, `get_settings`, `detect_network_proxy`, `get_ssh_status`, `list_ssh_config_hosts`, `get_local_codex_status`, `list_profiles`, `preview_profile_apply`, `detect_cc_switch_profiles`, `list_local_skills`, `list_skill_packs`, `get_skill_inventory_status`, `get_skill_targets`, `list_tasks`, `query_tasks`, `get_task`, `get_storage_health`, `preview_storage_migration`, `preview_storage_restore` | Invoke Tauri and surface errors. Task queries are paginated and return persistent acknowledgement state. Storage previews are read-only, fingerprinted plans and never mutate data. | Return labelled fixtures or isolated in-memory state. Storage previews never inspect desktop files. |
| Refresh or probe | `check_stable_update`, `list_hosts`, `refresh_discovered_hosts`, `test_ssh_connection`, `ssh_check`, `remote_probe_codex`, `batch_remote_probe_codex`, `preview_batch_remote_codex_update`, `sample_host_resources`, `refresh_latest_codex_version`, `detect_installed_skills` | Invoke Tauri; typed `ok: false` or error states remain failures. Live SSH requires validated non-empty aliases. Batch-update preview is read-only and returns compact current-user managed-release process identities for one combined confirmation. `sample_host_resources` records a task for initial/manual refreshes and explicitly skips task storage for scheduled auto-refresh. | Generate synthetic results and mirror the same resource-sampling task policy in isolated Mock state. |
| Local write | `save_settings`, `choose_close_button_behavior`, `generate_ed25519_key`, `upsert_ssh_config_host`, `delete_ssh_config_host`, `add_host`, `update_host`, `delete_host`, `create_profile`, `update_profile`, `delete_profile`, `duplicate_profile`, `import_profiles`, `set_profile_api_key`, `get_profile_api_key`, `delete_profile_api_key`, `import_cc_switch_profiles`, `import_local_skill`, `update_library_skill_about`, `download_github_skill`, `acknowledge_task`, `clear_task_history`, `record_frontend_error`, `apply_storage_migration`, `restore_storage_backup` | Invoke Tauri and reject on validation, persistence, task-journal, OS recycle-bin, or IPC failure. UI state changes only after confirmed backend success. API key retrieval remains sensitive output and may perform a journaled legacy credential migration after the explicit reveal action. Task-history deletion archives complete records to a JSON file in the system recycle bin before deleting completed SQLite rows. Storage apply/restore requires an unchanged preview fingerprint and preserves a recovery backup. | Modify isolated Mock state or explicitly report unsupported behavior. Mock task clearing affects only isolated in-memory state and never claims to access the OS recycle bin. Secret input is discarded after status is recorded; storage commands never access desktop files. |
| App or remote write | `install_stable_update`, `bootstrap_ssh_host`, `bootstrap_existing_ssh_host`, `remote_manage_codex`, `batch_remote_update_codex`, `apply_profile`, `install_skill_targets`, `uninstall_skill_targets`, `delete_library_skill`, `download_installed_skill`, `uninstall_installed_skill` | Require the existing preview/confirmation, backup/recovery, idempotency, alias validation, and redacted-log gates. | Produce labelled synthetic results with no local or remote mutation. |

The TypeScript `commandPolicies` registry and Rust `generate_handler!` list must remain identical. `pnpm test:api` enforces exact set equality and prevents `src/api/desktop.ts` from importing Mock or fallback implementations without relying on a brittle fixed command count.

`batch_remote_probe_codex(hostAliases, timeoutMs?, requestId?)` returns one batch `requestId`, one shared latest-Codex-version result, and input-ordered `{ hostAlias, ok, result?, error? }` items. `preview_batch_remote_codex_update(hostAliases, timeoutMs?, requestId?)` performs the read-only process scan. `batch_remote_update_codex(plans, timeoutMs?, requestId?)` accepts one validated `proceed`, `terminate`, `decline`, or `preflight-failed` plan per unique alias and returns `action: "update"` with the same input-ordered item envelope. The update backend revalidates the full current managed-release process set before any PATH or installer write, and a declined/preflight-failed plan creates an explicit failed task without remote mutation. All three use the required desktop invoke path and a fixed six-host backend pool. Invalid aliases or plans, global task-storage preflight failures, IPC failures, or batch-orchestration failures reject the command before work starts. After the pool starts, a per-host persistence, SSH, or maintenance failure becomes that host's typed failed item and prevents further work only for that host, while other hosts continue. Mock mode mirrors the envelopes and progress states without SSH or remote writes.

## Settings Authority

- Desktop `settings.json` under Tauri `app_config_dir()` is authoritative.
- Desktop browser storage is a first-render cache and updates only after a successful backend read or write.
- Mock settings use a separate browser-storage key. The legacy mixed key may be read once for Mock migration and is not deleted automatically.
- Desktop writes normalize values, skip unchanged content, retain timestamped managed backups before a change, and atomically replace a validated same-directory staging file.
- A settings failure keeps the last confirmed UI values active and exposes a retry action.

## Sensitive Inputs And SSH

- One-time passwords and API keys are masked by default. Reveal controls require an explicit user action and reset to masked whenever the modal is reopened.
- Passwords and API keys may cross IPC only for the explicit operation that needs them. `get_profile_api_key` is declared as sensitive output; its result is never logged or cached. Command errors and logs never include command arguments.
- Private key contents are never read or returned; only public keys and existence/path metadata are exposed.
- Commands with direct host targets validate aliases in the frontend and again in Rust before starting SSH/SFTP. Missing or invalid aliases produce failures without launching a process.

## Durable Write Gate

Every local durable write and live/long-running operation persists queued and running task state before the adapter is called. SSH/Codex progress is appended to SQLite with redaction and retained when the final state is written. If SQLite is unavailable, the operation does not start. A final task persistence failure is returned to the UI and marks task storage unhealthy for later writes. Event emission is diagnostic-only and cannot turn a failed persistence write into success.
