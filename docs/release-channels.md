# CodexHub Release Channels

Date: 2026-08-04
Version baseline: v0.5.1

CodexHub uses exactly two release channels: `dev` and `stable`.

## Channel Contract

| Channel | Purpose | Tauri config | productName | identifier | Window title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stable` | Public release candidate only after the requested validation passes and the user explicitly approves public availability. | `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `CodexHub` | `app.codexhub.desktop` | `CodexHub` |
| `dev` | Development, test runs, previews, and manual acceptance before promotion. | `src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json` | `CodexHub Dev` | `dev.codexhub.desktop` | `CodexHub Dev` |

Do not add extra channels such as alpha, beta, nightly, staging, rc, or preview. Preview and manual acceptance builds belong to `dev`.

## Local Data Isolation

Runtime app state must use Tauri's app-scoped paths:

- Config state uses `app.path().app_config_dir()`.
- Cache state uses `app.path().app_cache_dir()`.
- Tauri resolves those paths under the OS config/cache roots plus the bundle identifier.

On Windows, this means:

| Channel | Config directory | Cache directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stable` | `%APPDATA%\app.codexhub.desktop` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\app.codexhub.desktop` |
| `dev` | `%APPDATA%\dev.codexhub.desktop` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.codexhub.desktop` |

The persisted files under those directories include `settings.json`, `hosts.json`, `profiles.json`, `skills.json`, `skills-inventory.json`, `codex-latest.json`, managed skill copies, profile-apply temp files, and cloned skill cache.

## What Is Not Isolated Automatically

Channel isolation covers the local Tauri app identity and app-owned config/cache directories only. It does not automatically isolate:

- `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\known_hosts`
- Local SSH key files
- Remote `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Remote `~/.codex/skills/`
- Remote shell files such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

Any operation touching those shared local or remote surfaces must keep the existing CodexHub safety rules: explicit user action, scoped writes, backups before mutation, idempotent behavior, and redacted task logs.

## Build Entry Points

Stable is the default package identity:

```powershell
pnpm build:tauri
pnpm build:installer:nsis
pnpm build:installer:msi
pnpm build:installer:nsis:updater
pnpm build:linux:release
```

Dev uses the dev Tauri override:

```powershell
pnpm dev
pnpm build:tauri:dev
pnpm build:installer:nsis:dev
pnpm build:installer:msi:dev
pnpm release:portable:dev
```

Do not create a GitHub Release from the `dev` channel. Do not create any GitHub Release until the user explicitly approves publishing the `stable` build.

## GitHub Actions Boundary

Code pushes and pull requests to `master` run the lightweight `CI` workflow only. That workflow validates source state with smoke checks, mock smoke checks, TypeScript typechecking, the web build, and Rust tests. It does not build installers, produce desktop release bundles, upload assets, or change updater feeds.

Platform release workflows are manual-only:

- `.github/workflows/build-windows-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-macos-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-linux-release.yml`

Run those workflows with `workflow_dispatch` only after the owner has approved a stable publication. Each workflow normalizes the input tag, requires it to equal `v${package.version}`, fetches the tag, and requires the checked-out HEAD to equal the tag commit before any build proceeds. Public Release assets are uploaded only when the manual run sets `upload_to_release=true` and targets that existing GitHub Release tag.

## Stable Updater Boundary

Only `stable` may use the Tauri updater. The current foundation wires the updater plugin, Settings status/check UI, a gated install action, update-check Task history, a Windows signed-updater release workflow, an unsigned/ad-hoc Apple Silicon macOS updater release path, and signed Linux `.deb` feed entries for `linux-x86_64` plus `linux-aarch64`. The stable Check button remains clickable so formal builds can report their updater state; without both `CODEXHUB_STABLE_UPDATE_ENDPOINT` and `CODEXHUB_STABLE_UPDATER_PUBKEY`, the backend returns `pending-configuration`. Failed checks open a log dialog and remain reviewable from Tasks. Install stays disabled until a signed stable feed returns `available`.

`dev` must not auto-update from any feed. Dev builds are local source runs, preview packages, or test artifacts only.

`pnpm release:portable` remains available for manual/local packaging, but the v0.5.1 Windows public Release keeps only the signed updater-enabled setup installer. macOS uses an unsigned/ad-hoc Apple Silicon `.dmg` for user installation and `.app.tar.gz` for updater delivery; its real-device validation baseline is complete and must be repeated after relevant lifecycle or packaging changes. Linux uses Ubuntu/Debian `amd64` and `arm64` `.deb` packages for installation and signed updater feed entries after Linux validation. Portable builds do not participate in automatic update feeds unless a separate portable update story is designed and tested.
