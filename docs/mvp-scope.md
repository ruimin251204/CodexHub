# CodexHub MVP Scope

Date: 2026-07-30

## MVP Goal

Build a desktop app that helps a user manage Codex App SSH multi-server workflows safely. The first version is a control plane for remote Codex config and skills, with a bounded SSH Workspace for the user's existing aliases; it does not replace Codex App or introduce private App integration.

## In Scope

- Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite desktop skeleton.
- Desktop UI and local smoke/mock mode.
- Local server inventory model.
- Read-only parsing of the local SSH config path for the current platform.
- Read-only auto-import of safe existing SSH `Host` aliases into CodexHub inventory.
- Optional SSH host-block generator.
- Optional append/update of CodexHub-managed SSH config blocks with backup.
- SSH connectivity check through the system OpenSSH client.
- Remote system and Codex probe: OS, arch, shell, PATH, installed Codex path, `command -v codex`, `codex --version`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, API env readiness, `~/.codex/skills/`.
- Remote Codex CLI maintenance through SSH: single-host Test, Install, Update, and Uninstall, plus user-triggered batch Test and Update through a fixed six-host sliding concurrency pool. Every Update completes read-only managed-release process scans before confirmation; users may approve only safely classified identities, while declined, unknown, changed, and unverifiable hosts fail without PATH or installer mutation. Per-host install/update fallback stages remain sequential, target the remote user's home directory, and keep the user-facing command as `codex`; the primary UI entry is the host table on the Hosts / 主机 page.
- Shared local-proxy fan-out for install/update: every concurrent host may open an independent loopback-only SSH reverse tunnel to the same eligible local HTTP/HTTPS proxy, try the official installer through that tunnel first, and fall back to direct/mirror routes without persisting remote proxy settings.
- Shared managed-runtime reconciliation for Install/Update and Profile apply: serialize CodexHub runtime writers with a current-UID/PID/starttime lock, re-read a monotonic version floor after locking, keep a verified standalone target on the exact executable selected through `~/.codex/packages/standalone/current`, support legacy/local and official release layouts, verify target/launcher/login-shell versions agree, and reject lower candidates or post-write states.
- Safe old-runtime cleanup after final verification: Install/Profile apply remove only direct, strictly marked CodexHub-managed releases and captures. Update additionally adopts every uniquely laid-out, entry/version-matched release strictly below the verified new version and moves eligible releases, captures, and known residual links into a timestamped staged backup under `~/.codex-hub/deletion-backups/`. Keep current, targeted, same/newer, invalid-marker, ambiguous, or current-UID in-use versions, marking an otherwise eligible in-use old release for a later retry; all cleanup uses the shared writer lock and same-filesystem no-replace moves. Only staged Update may classify and snapshot stable current-user `sshd`, `(sd-pam)`, `sftp-server`, or `fusermount3` helpers whose executable link is unreadable; every later candidate check must match the initial UID/PID/starttime/comm/full-argv0 identity, while ManagedOnly and all unknown or changed processes still defer.
- Durable host-operation steps shared by live progress and Tasks history. Summary cards are collapsed by default, including failures, and reveal redacted command/stdout/stderr diagnostics only after explicit expansion.
- Idempotent remote PATH repair for `~/.local/bin` in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, `.profile`, and existing `.bash_profile` / `.zprofile` with backup-before-write and task-log evidence.
- Remote `~/.codex/config.toml` read, diff, backup, render, and replace.
- Local profile templates rendered to remote config, with create, update, delete, import, export, and single or selected-host batch apply.
- Env-var-first API key config: remote TOML uses `env_key` / `apiKeyEnvVar`; applying a profile with a stored local key writes the real value only to the selected host's `~/.codex-hub/env` with restrictive permissions and redacted logs; readiness checks verify only whether the remote env var exists.
- A per-apply confirmation for remote Codex process activation: recommended App-service reload, no reload, or acknowledged termination of all strictly confirmed Codex sessions owned by the current remote SSH UID.
- Safe remote reload through Linux `/proc` identity/start-time checks and `SIGTERM` only: wait up to five seconds for old PIDs, then observe a replacement App service for at most 15 seconds total after TERM. Failed reload preserves the applied configuration and reports manual reconnect guidance.
- `applied-profile.json` metadata and redacted Tasks logs for each profile apply.
- Local skill import and managed-copy persistence for directories containing `SKILL.md`.
- Direct GitHub repository or `tree/<branch>/<skill-path>` URL download/import for skill discovery.
- Local skill inventory detection across the local Codex skills root and remembered host `~/.codex/skills/` lists.
- Skill library table actions for preview, install, uninstall, and delete across the local machine and configured hosts.
- Operation log with backups and restore points.
- Codex App fallback wizard for host enablement and reconnect guidance.
- Workspace / 工作台: Terminal, Files, Split, and Transfers modes backed by real desktop-only Tauri commands. Terminal uses local PTY + system OpenSSH. Files defaults to the first live Terminal host, or to the real local filesystem (`C:/` on Windows) when no Terminal exists; remote targets use alias-bound SFTP. Mock explicitly returns `desktop-backend-required` and never invents a shell, file list, or transfer progress.
- Bounded Workspace lifecycle: logical terminal session IDs, generation-checked output/input/resize/ACK, replay buffer, bounded auto-reconnect, close/exit cleanup, and transient heartbeat events.
- Safe local and remote file browsing, preview, bounded search, create/copy/move/rename, regular-file upload/download queueing, pause/retry/cancel, checksum verification, explicit conflict resolution, and recovery-backed delete/overwrite/rename with a second purge confirmation. A persisted interrupted transfer needs a fresh local grant and matching Files session before resume or retry.

## Explicitly Out Of Scope For MVP

- Mandatory remote Codex wrapper.
- Automatic writes to Codex App private state.
- Automatic Codex App SSH host registration through undocumented interfaces.
- Forced local ChatGPT/Codex App SSH reconnect through undocumented interfaces.
- A standalone Host action for remote Codex reload; the first version exposes it only as part of profile apply.
- Reading or writing local ChatGPT/Codex App private databases, sockets, caches, or IPC.
- Broad cleanup of unmarked releases outside the verified Update adoption policy, automatic permanent deletion of staged Update backups, or cleanup of unmanaged captures, current, targeted, same/newer, in-use, invalid-marker, or identity-ambiguous Codex objects.
- Mandatory remote terminal daemon, tmux dependency, or any promise to restore a disconnected foreground program.
- A claim of live SSH/PTY/SFTP compatibility before a dedicated test alias and real-device acceptance have completed.
- Multi-user team server, RBAC, schedules, unattended fleet automation, configurable fleet-wide concurrency, and bulk Codex install/uninstall orchestration beyond the user-triggered batch Test and Update actions.
- Storing private keys, passphrases, or tokens in plaintext.
- Writing local credential-store key names or API key values into remote Codex config.
- Default overwrite of user SSH config, Codex config, shell config, or remote dotfiles.

## MVP Safety Gates

Each mutating operation must have:

- Dry-run preview.
- Diff or clear planned action summary.
- Timestamped backup if a file already exists.
- Idempotent behavior on repeat apply.
- Restore path when possible.
- Redacted operation log.
- Explicit process-impact confirmation before remote reload; stopping all sessions requires an additional acknowledgement.
- A process-impact confirmation before every Update mutation; revalidate UID/PID/starttime/release/comm/process-kind identity before individual `SIGTERM`, and record a failed no-mutation task for every declined, unknown, changed, or unverifiable host.
- A no-downgrade runtime check before an Update/Profile apply is accepted, plus conservative defer-on-uncertainty rules for old managed-release cleanup.
